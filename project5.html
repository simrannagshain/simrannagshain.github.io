                <p>Project Description: For this assignment, I decided to do flowers that represented each month. I researched each month and which flower was associated with that month. I then found videos on YouTube of those flowers. This is basically a compilation video of 12 months of flowers. I added about 10 second length clips of each flower. Some videos have someone speaking about the flower as well. I added effects to transition between each video. The transitons were those from Adobe Premiere Pro. I also transitioned the text to go along with the video and display which month each flower is.</p>
