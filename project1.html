                <p>Project Description: Using an image I found on Google Images, I used a sound software called Audacity to glitch the image. I played a round with the sound that would then affect the image. I would cut and copy paste some parts of the sound to make the image distort. If I did too much, the image would break, and I would have to start over. I really enjoyed this project and made some really cool artwork with it. I used this technique for another class assignment I had and got many compiments on it.</p>
